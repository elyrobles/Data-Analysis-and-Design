# Data-Analysis-and-Design

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem I was trying to solve in the projects for this course was to load a csv file into my chosen data structure. After solving that problem, the program would then allow users to check the required courses for the CS major. With this program students would also be able to load a csv file into a Binary Search Tree data structure then choose to either view the full alphanumeric order schedule or search for a specific course and its information by typing in a course number. 

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the probelm by first creating pseudocode for all data structures we learned about in this course, which included Trees, Vectors, and Hash Tables. I then weighed out the pros and cons for using each of the structures and ultimately came to the decision to use a Tree for the project. Trees allowed for very fast data search and Inorder traversal, it was also the data structure I felt the most confident using. Data structures are important to undestand because they permit for data  organization, storage, and the retrieval of specific information; not using a data structure would make it very difficult to find information we need from a large set of data. Data structures can help sovle real-world issues such as searching for a word in an online dictionary, inserting a new student into an already exisiting large database, or retrieving employee information at a large corporation, just to name a few examples. 

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

One of my main roadblocks I encountered while going through the activities and projects was writing pseudocode. I understand that it is best practice to create pseudocode before writing the code for an application but it is something I am not good at doing yet, I find that coding straight away is a lot easier for me to do at the moment. Although I would love to say that I overcame this roadblock, that simply would not be the truth, it is a matter that I will need to continue to cultivate. I plan on doing that by practicing how I think a program should run and then create a strategy for the steps I will need to take to acheive that in plain English. Hopefully by doing these practice problems I will become better at writing pseudocode beofore writing the actual code.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

My work on this project has expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs because I now understand the importance of data structures and the need for them when working with large or small databases. I now have the tools I need to choose the appropriate data structure for software I will design in the future.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

My work on this project has also evolved the way I write programs that are maintabibale, readable, and adaptable. I try my best to follow C++ best coding practices which include writing code that could be easily understood by other developers, this involves explaining all the steps I take when writing code to the best of my ability, following specific rules that'll ensure the security and safety of the program I am writing, and lastly, ensuring that my code is reliable.
